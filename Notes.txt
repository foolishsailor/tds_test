1.  Not familiar with oracle - spent time installing local oracle basic client and conencting to db
2.  Keeping .env files in repo to simplify compiolng for test
3.  added dependency injection in service
4.  know i need to do date comparison in tests for active badge - cant remmber how to to greaterthan for object in array
5.  would normally build and tear down db for testing - especially for testing edge case sql queries like the one suggessted below
6.  becasue not creating db there is some fragility in tests with coded values for departments etc


notes on suggested improvements:
Im not sure the suggested criteria ofr an active employee reflects a real world example.

requested criteria:
1.  leave date == null or
2. leave date in the past

query = 'SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE LEAVE_DATE IS NULL OR LEAVE_DATE < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'

This would result in the following empployees also being included as "active";
1.  Employees who have already left orginzation - leave date in past
2.  Employees who have start dates in the future, like new hires that have been entered in system but arent currently live

Suggested criteria and query

I assume an "active employee" is one who is curretnly working at said organization and therefore would have the following criteria met:
1. start date IS NOT NULL and before NOW
2. leave date null or after now

query = 'SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE (START_DATE IS NOT NULL AND START_DATE < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AND (LEAVE_DATE IS NULL OR LEAVE_DATE > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)'
